is_declared() checks that a given name exists in our variable table, and returns true if yes, otherwise false
it uses a range-for loop with a constant reference object that refers to the given element in the table, from
first to last.
on each iteration, there is a check if the current variable has the given name, and if yes, the function returns true
if we went through each element, the for loop exits, and the function returns false
