operator overloading should be used for operations with their conventional meaning

for example, we could overload the subscript operator [] for container types,
we could overload << for using the ostream objects to print
or >> to use istreams to read values into our objects of class types

an overloaded operator must take at least one user-defined type

operators that can be overloaded:
= += -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= <<= >>=
++(prefix) (postfix)++ --(prefix) (postfix)--
+(unary) -(unary) + - * / % ~ & | ^ << >> !
== != < > <= >= <=>
() [] *(unary) &(unary) ->
(these shouldn't really be overloaded:) && || ,
