users can directly interact with the data members of Date,
there are no member functions, only plain data, so it can be tiring and error-prone to interact with the type,
we can input any invalid value into the data members, there is no validity checking for the variables,
we can accidentally leave a Date object in an undefined state, by not initializing each member: there is no (default) constructor
users can write any kind of nonsense logic for any operation, for example there is no standard uniform way of validity checking or adding one day
