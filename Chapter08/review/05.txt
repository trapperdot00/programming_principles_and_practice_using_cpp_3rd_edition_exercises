an invariant is a rule specifying the valid values that a type's variables can take
usually we check if an invariant holds in constructors, assignment operators and functions that change the data members' values

for example:
 - for Date, we used an invariant that checks whether month is in [1;12] range, that is from Month::jan to Month::dec inclusive
 - for Date, we used an invariant that checks whether day is in [1;31] range, but it could use some improvement
