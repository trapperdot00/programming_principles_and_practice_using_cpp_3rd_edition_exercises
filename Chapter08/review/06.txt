we should provide a minimal set of member functions that are complete,
so that when we encounter a bug, we can narrow down the possible functions to check for errors

when we can efficiently, elegantly and simply implement an operation as a helper (non-member) function,
we should do so, so that we don't corrupt the data in an object
bugs are significantly more likely to occur in functions that can access the representation of the class, for example member functions

when we need to access the representation of the class, we should use member functions,
but we should keep their number small, because if the representation changes, we have to rewrite those functions
