Rational can represent a rational number, meaning that it can represent
any number that can be calculated by dividing a number by another one

Money allows numbers that only have maximum two digits after the decimal dot

Rational can represent numbers with higher precision than Money

example:
	11/3:
		- Rational can store it as a whole with no loss of precision,
		which can be converted to double as 3.66666666....
		- Money could store it only in its decimal form, up to 2 digits after the dot: 3.66
