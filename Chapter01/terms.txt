//				character sequence to start a single line comment
executable		code that has been compiled and now is in runnable format
main()			the necessary function of any C++ program
				the operating system calls this function
				its return value indicates the success of the program: nonzero is failure, zero is success
<<				the operator used to print characters to the console
function		a callable named sequence of instructions
				four parts: return type, name, parameter list, function body
object code		the compiler generates this from source code files,
				this is understandable by computers
C++				programming language that supports object oriented programming, functional programming,
				metaprogramming. it is a compiled language
header file		file that you can put code into that can be #included in other source files, which means it is copied
output			output of a code can be the characters printed to the terminal, or files
comment			text ignored by the compiler that can help programmers understand the logic of the code
IDE				integrated development environment: makes coding more comfortable and faster by
				color coding keywords, simplifying compilation and the ability to debug
program			a program is a set of instructions to the computer in a format that is understandable by the computer
compiler		the program that generates object code files from source files
import			the keyword used to load a specific named module into our program, and make it accessible to us
source code		the human-readable code, without comments
compile-time	compile-time errors are noticed by the compiler, and it is easier to debug than link-time errors
error			when something acts not according to plan
library			the standard library (STL) is a collection of codes that we can use in our programs freely
statement		a statement is a code part that is equal to one sentence, it is terminated by a semicolon
cout			the object that we can use to write characters to the terminal
linker			the program that links multiple object code files and makes an executable from them
module			a C++ language feature that replaces the #include directives and header files,
				allows us to load facilities from other source files
#include		a C++ language feature to copy and paste a header or source file into our source or header file
std				the standard library's namespace prefix
command line	the terminal (CLI), a text based display
bug				an error in a program that makes it misbehave
debugging		the act of finding and eliminating bugs
