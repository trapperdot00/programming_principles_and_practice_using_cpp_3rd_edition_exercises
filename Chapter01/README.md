# Drill

## 1
Figure out how to compile and run a program on your machine. This may be a good time to get a bit of help from someone who has done that before.

## 2
If you use an IDE, set up an empty console C++ project called `hello_world`. Otherwise, if you plan to use the command line, get a command window, figure out how to use an editor to type in your code, and see §0.3.1.

## [3](drill/03)
Type in `hello_world.cpp`, exactly as specified below, save it in your practice directory (folder), and include it in your `hello_world` project.
```
import std;
int main()  // C++ programs start by executing the function main
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n"; // output "Hello, World!"
}
```
What if you don’t have an up-to-date C++ implementation that supports module std? Then, use a less elegant and less efficient technique that has worked since the early days of C: #include a header file as is explained in §7.7.2:
```
#include<iostream>
int main()  // C++ programs start by executing the function main
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n"; // output "Hello, World!"
}
```

## [4](drill/04)
Compile and run the “Hello, World!” program. An IDE will have a compile-and-run button. Even something as simple as “Hello, World!” very rarely compiles and runs in a first attempt to use a new programming language or a new programming environment.
Find the problem and fix it! This is a point where asking for help from a more experienced person is sensible, but be sure to understand what you are shown so that you can do it all by yourself before proceeding further.

## [5](drill/05)
By now, you have probably encountered some errors and had to correct them. Now is the time to get a bit better acquainted with your compiler’s error-detection and error-reporting facilities! Try the eight programs from §1.3 to see how your programming environment reacts. Think of at least five more errors you might have made typing in your program (e.g., leave the Caps Lock key on while typing a word, or type a comma instead of a semicolon) and try each to see what happens when you try to compile and run those versions.
