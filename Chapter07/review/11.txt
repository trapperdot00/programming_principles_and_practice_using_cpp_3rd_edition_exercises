 - module scope		the scope within a module
 - namespace scope	a named scope inside the global scope or in another namespace
 - class scope		the scope within a class
 - local scope		the scope between the curly braces of a block or in a function argument list
 - statement scope	the scope opened by a for-loop, while loop or any statement (like an if with an initializer)
