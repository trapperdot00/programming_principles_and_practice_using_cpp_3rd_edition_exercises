a declaration only introduces a name into a scope, specifying the type for the named entity, and an initializer

kinds of declarations:
 - variable declaration: with 'extern' keyword
 - function declaration: with semicolon after parentheses instead of a function body '{}'

a definition specifies what exactly a name refers to, allocates memory or specifies a function body
multiple declarations can exist but there can only be one definition for a given object
