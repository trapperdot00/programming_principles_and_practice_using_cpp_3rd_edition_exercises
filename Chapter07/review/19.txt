x && y
	this expression returns true if x and y is true, else false
	short circuit evaluation: first x is checked, and only if it is true, then y is checked
x || y
	this expression returns true if either x or y is true, or both are true, else false
	short circuit evaluation: first x is checked, and only if it is false, then y is checked

we can use the short circuit evaluation in conditions where we check the validity of a pointer and
after that the value pointed by it
