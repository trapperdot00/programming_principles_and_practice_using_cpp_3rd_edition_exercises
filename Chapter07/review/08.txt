the suffix return type notation is a type of notation for providing
the function's return type after the parameter list
you have to use 'auto' on the original return-type location, and have to put an '->' after the parentheses,
after which you can put the return type
you might use it to make functions' names align with each other, as they would use auto on the left-hand side
you can also deduce the returned type from the return statement in the function with omitting the arrow and the type
