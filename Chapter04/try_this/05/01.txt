a hexagon consists of six triangles, whose angles are 60Â° each
the six triangles are equilateral triangles, every side is 2 cm
the height of the triangles is the square root of three
we can calculate (or rather estimate) the hexagon's area by this formula: area = 6 * a * h / 2
subtituted to: 6 * 2 * sqrt(3) / 2
is equal to: 10.3623
