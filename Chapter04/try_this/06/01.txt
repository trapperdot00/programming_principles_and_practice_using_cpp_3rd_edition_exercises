it takes ~1800 miles to get from New York City to Denver
we can assume that if the maximum speed limit in the US is 85 mph and most of the journey would consist of driving on highways,
that our average speed would be around 80 mph
my estimate is 22.5 hours
a flight would take around 5 hours

from London to Nice is ~900 miles
if the speed limit is around 80 mph, we can assume an average speed of 70 mph
thus my estimate is 11.25 hours of non-stop driving
a flight would take around 3 hours
