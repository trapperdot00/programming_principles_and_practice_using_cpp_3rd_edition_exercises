a type error is an error found by the compiler after checking for syntax errors in a single source code file

these errors are found when we
 - mismatch the types we declared for identifiers
 - assigning to objects values of conflicting types without conversion from that type to the desired one
 - providing the bad amount of arguments to functions
 - providing bad types for functions

examples:
	int func(int i);

	std::string s1 = func(1);
	int num1 = func();
	int num2 = func(1, 2);
	int num3 = myfunc(1);
	int num3 = "hello";
