a logic error is an error that neither the compiler nor the linker caught, that is detected by checks in the program
these are errors that produce crashes, or no crash but the wrong results
these errors can be detected by the computer, library or the user code

examples:
	int perimeter(int i, int j) {
		return 2*(i+j);
	}

	double d = 15.6/0;
	int i = sqrt(-2);
	int p = perimeter(-10, 10);
