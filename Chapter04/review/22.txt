the steps of debugging a program:
 - get the program to compile
 - get the program to link
 - examine the output
 - go through the execution of the program step by step like a computer
 - insert assertions (statements that check invariants) into suspected code harboring bugs
 - insert assertions into sections of code not suspected of harboring bugs
