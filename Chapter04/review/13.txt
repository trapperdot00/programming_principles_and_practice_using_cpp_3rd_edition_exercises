we could let the caller of a function handle run-time errors
or let the called function handle the errors

we would check for errors in the caller function, if the called function was non-modifiable, such as in a library
aside from this, we should never use this approach, as it makes the code larger, ugly, and more error-prone,
we have to make sure that we know the inner workings of the called function, or what valid arguments we can pass,
and we would have to check from every place we call the function

we should check for errors in the called function, or the callee when we can
we only have to write the checking part only once, in the function
