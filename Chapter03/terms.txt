abstraction				the act of hiding implementation details behind a convenient interface
range-for-statement		a for-statement that allows directly going over elements of a container
push_back()				puts an element to the back of a container
for-statement			an iteration statement that specifies an initializer, a condition, an operation that is run after each iteration, and a statement
function				a named sequence of statements that can be called, has a return type, an identifier, a parenthesized parameter list and a body that is a block
repetition				iteration
computation				taking some input and producing some output
if-statement			a selection statement, that may choose between two alternatives with an else based on a condition
rvalue					a value that can stand on the right-hand side of an assignment, provides the value
conditional statement	a selection statement that uses the ?: operator to select between two alternatives
increment				++, increments an integer or a floating-point value by one, it requires an lvalue: modifies the object
selection				used to select among alternatives, with the if-statement, switch-statement or a conditional
declaration				introducing the type and a name of a variable, or the return type, name and parameters of a function
input					any kinds of data that is passed to our program or parts of program
size()					container member function that returns the number of elements
definition				setting aside memory for an object; function definition: the function declaration with a body, can be elsewhere
iteration				a loop execution
sort()					a standard library function, that sorts the elements in a container
divide-and-conquer		separating a large problem into more, smaller pieces
loop					an iteration-statement: for-loop, range-for-loop, while-loop
statement				basic unit controlling the execution flow
else					the statement under an else is executed if the condition in the if-statement evaluates to false
lvalue					a value that can stand on the left-hand side of an assignment, it provides direct access to the object
switch-statement		a selection-statement that compares an integer, char or an enumeration to constant values
while-statement			an iteration-statement that consists of a condition and a body
member function			functions defined inside a class
vector					an STL container, that provides fast random access to its elements, grows dynamically and is easy to use
expression				computes a value from a set of operands and an optional operator
output					the output from a program, part of a program, that other parts can manage as input
