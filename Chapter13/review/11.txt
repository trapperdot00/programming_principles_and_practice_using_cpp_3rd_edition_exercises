For two-dimensional graphs, we need to scale the x and y axes to make our inputs fit.
We can get a scaling factor by dividing the size of the given axis
with the range of the corresponding dataset.
Then we can align the input data to a coordinate by subtracting the minimal value from it,
multiplying that with the scale, and adding it to the given axis' starting coordinate.
