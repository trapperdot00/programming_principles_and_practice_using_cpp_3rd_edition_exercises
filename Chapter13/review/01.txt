A function of one argument is a function that takes one parameter.
Whether it does something with that argument is up to the function.

For example, the horizontal line function discards the given argument,
by not even naming the variable, only the type of it, and returns one for every value given;
however the sloping line returns the argument multiplied by 0.5.

The graphics type, Function, takes a function that takes one argument of type double, and returns double.

We use continuous lines for visualizing functions of one argument.
