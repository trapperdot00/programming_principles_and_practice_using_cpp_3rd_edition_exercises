We plan the general layout of our graphs by first asking ourselves
what would we want to see in our window.
We need to consider the position and the size of our rectangle space
that will hold the graph and its values.
We also need to consider whether there would be any captions, and where to put them.
Also the colors of the lines, whether there will even be lines, or simply just marks.

We can easily reflect these ideas in code:
we can put the offsets and spacings and coordinates in symbolic constants,
and we can represent captions as Text objects.
We can even assign colors and line styles for our polylines or marks,
that would represent our data.
