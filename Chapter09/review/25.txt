 - we should separate logically distinct computations into their own separate functions
 - when dealing with files, we should first try to open the file and check if it really opened without errors,
 	so that we can proceed with the calculations (it would be unnecessary work if it didn't open)
 - separating input and output into their own separate functions and relying on the files closing at the end
 	of the function scope minimizes the chances of someone trying to use a file stream after it has been closed
 - directly supplying a constructor with a filename for a file stream object minimizes the chance of users
 	using the file stream incorrectly
