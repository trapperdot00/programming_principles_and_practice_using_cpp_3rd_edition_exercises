std::setprecision():
	manipulator that sets the precision for floating-point numbers for all subsequent operations (sticky)
	precision is either the total number of digits in a float (defaultfloat)
	or the number of digits after the decimal point (fixed, scientific)
	it can be passed to streams using << or >> operators

	(not manipulator form)
	can be called as member functions (with name precision) for given streams (e.g. std::cout.precision(6))

std::setw():
	manipulator that sets the following field's width to a given number of characters of width
	can be used on ostreams using the << operator
	non-sticky: only applies to the following print
