Stream states:
 - str.good():
	The stream is in a valid state (no eof, fail or bad), ready for next operation,
	last operation succeeded
	Can be checked by using the stream in a condition (operator bool overload)

 - str.eof():
	The stream read end-of-file (eof) character,
	no more data can be read

 - str.fail():
	The stream encountered an unexpected error,
	from which we can recover (usually format or type error)

 - str.bad():
	The stream encountered an unexpected and serious error,
	from which it cannot recover (disk error)
	Also sets failbit implicitly
