'<< hex':

std::hex is an i/o manipulator, changes the given (i/o)stream's state:
	when given to an istream, the variables read after the manipulator will be read as hexadecimal values
	when given to an ostream, the data outputted after the manipulator will be printed as hexadecimal values
the manipulator is 'sticky': needs to be explicitly reset, won't reset to std::dec automatically,
which is the manipulator for decimal representations
hex can be applied to integers

in this example, we can see that there is an output operator before the manipulator, so we can assume
that it is given to an ostream:
	any data printed after the manipulator will be printed as hexadecimal if the type supports it
