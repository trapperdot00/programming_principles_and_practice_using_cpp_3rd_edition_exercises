we use Qt (and the C++ standard library) to implement our graphics/GUI interface library
we avoid using the operating system directly, as it would make our code operating system dependent,
wouldn't be portable for other systems
Qt deals with portability issues, our programs work on Linux, Windows, Android, Mac, etc.
