screen coordinates start from the top-left corner of the physical screen,
the top-left pixel is (0;0)
the x-coordinate increases to the right,
the y-coordinate increases downwards
only 0 and positive numbers are possible in a given coordinate

window coordinates start from the top-left of the window (virtual screen),
the top-left pixel is (0;0),
increases using the same logic as with screen coordinates

it differs from mathematical coordinates:
the mathematical y-coordinates grow upwards, whereas in screens it grows downwards
mathematical coordinates can be negative, while it can't in screens (in a meaningful way)
