Get an empty `Simple_window` with the size 600 by 400 and a label `My window` compiled, linked, and run. Note that you have to link the Qt library, `#include Graph.h` and `Simple_window.h` in your code, and compile and link `Graph.cpp` and `Window.cpp` into your program.

## [Drill 2](drill/02)
Now add the examples from ยง10.7 one by one, testing between each added subsection example.

## [Drill 3](drill/03)
