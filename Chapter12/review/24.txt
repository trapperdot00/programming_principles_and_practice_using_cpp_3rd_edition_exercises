Object-oriented programming consists of
 - Inheritance
 	- we can build a class from another so that it can be used in place of the base class
 - Run-time polymorphism
 	- we can define virtual functions which we can override in derived classes
	- we can call a virtual function from a base class, and the derived class' function will be executed,
		which is looked up at run-time from the vtable
 - Encapsulation
 	- we can keep the implementation members private or protected to prevent users from directly accessing
		and modifying the implementation, invalidating the state of our objects
	- we can provide a public interface to interact with the implementation in well-defined ways
