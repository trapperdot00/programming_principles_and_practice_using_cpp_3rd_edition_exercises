We would use virtual member functions so as to allow its usage
through the interfaces provided by its base.
The base knows about the virtual functions, and it is determined
at run-time which function is called, according to the object's dynamic type.
This allows us to modify the behaviour of our objects while keeping the interfaces
the same.
