We should suppress copy operations for the base class in a class hierarchy
so as to disallow assignment of derived classes of differing types,
and preventing object slicing.
For example, if Shape had defined copy operations, we could assign
a Rectangle to a Circle, because their bases are common, and due to
polymorphism, the copy operation that takes a constant reference to
a Shape is called, and effectively only the Shape part of the object
is assigned to the other.
