Shape is an abstract class that provides the general interface of a graphical object,
along with the common implementation for visible objects, such as color, line style, etc.
 - It ties our graphical objects to a Window.
 - It deals with color and style for our lines and fills.
 - It holds a sequence of points but leaves it up to our classes to interpret them.
 - It provides a draw_specifics() function that derived classes must define (since it is a pure virtual function).
