A virtual function is a member function whose definition can be overridden by derived classes.
Virtual functions are looked up at run-time, when calling the base class' function by the same name,
the derived class' function will be called based on its dynamic type.
Non-virtual functions on the other hand are called at compile-time, based on the static type of the object.
Classes with virtual functions have an additional, hidden member, a vptr, that points to a vtable,
a container that keeps track of the available virtual functions' definitions for the current type.
