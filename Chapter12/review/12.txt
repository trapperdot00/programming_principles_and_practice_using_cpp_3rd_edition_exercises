Object layout is the layout of the objects in memory.
Data members are stored contiguously, next to each other,
in derived classes, first the base's members, then the derived's members are stored.
In classes with virtual functions, there is also another member, a vptr (virtual pointer),
that points to a vtbl (virtual function table) as the last member.
