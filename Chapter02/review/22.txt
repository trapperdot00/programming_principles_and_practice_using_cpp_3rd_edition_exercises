don't define variables with names that differ in their cases
choose meaningful names with easily understandable meanings
don't use acronyms or abbreviations
use x only for local variables or parameters
use i only for loop indexes
don't use overly long names
don't use fully uppercase names, as those are reserved for macros
avoid names that are easy to mistype or misread or confuse (0 o O, i 1 I l)
