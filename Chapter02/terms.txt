definition		a declaration that sets aside memory for an object
operation		a possible operation for a type
cin				the object used to read from the standard input into a specified object
increment		++ operator, adds one to an int
operator		a built-in operation's notation
concatenation	the act of putting two strings together ("ab" + "cd" = "abcd")
initialization	providing an initial value for an object
type			defines a set of possible operations and values for an object
conversion		converting an object of a type to another type, narrowing of widening can happen
name			the name of a variable
type safety		dictates that an object of a type can only be used according to its definition
declaration		a statement that gives a name and a type to an object
narrowing		a conversion that may lose information
value			a set of bits interpreted according to a type
decrement		-- operator, subtracts one from an int
object			some memory that holds a value of a given type
variable		a named object
widening		a conversion that preserves information
truncation		conversion from double to int, truncates the numbers after the decimal point
int				integer, usually 4 bytes of size, can hold integers
double			double-precision floating point number, usually 8 bytes of size
string			a standard library type that represents a sequence of characters

!=				inequality operator
=				assignment operator
