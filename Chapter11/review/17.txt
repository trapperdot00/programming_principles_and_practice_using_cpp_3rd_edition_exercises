it would just unnecessarily pollute our library
a simple Triangle only assumes that a polygon has three points, nothing else
three points cannot produce intersecting sides
it would be better to only define RightAngleTriangle, or something else,
but it is still unnecessary, as there is Polygon or Closed_polyline for that
